## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the application's state efficiently.

## Why React is known as ‘React’?

The name ‘React’ was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to react to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.
